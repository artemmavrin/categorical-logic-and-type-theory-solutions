\begin{exercise}
Let \(I\) be a set.
A \textbf{partition} of \(I\) is a collection \(Q \subseteq P(I)\) of subsets of \(I\) satisfying (1) every set in \(Q\) is non-empty (2) if \(a, b \in Q\) and \(a \cap b \neq \emptyset\), then \(a = b\) (3) \(\bigcup Q = I\).
A \textbf{partial partition} of \(I\) is a subset \(Q \subseteq P(I)\) satisfying (1) and (2) but not necessarily (3).
Show that
\begin{parts}
\part
there is a bijective correspondence between partitions and equivalence
relations and between partial partitions and partial equivalence relations (on \(I\));
\part
there is a bijective correspondence between partial equivalence relations on \(I\) and equivalence relations on subsets of \(I\).
