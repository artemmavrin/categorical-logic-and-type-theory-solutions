\begin{exercise}
Show that a map \(\nabla X \to (\mathbb{N} / R, \in)\) in \(\omegaSets\) is constant (where \(X\) is a set and \(R\) is a PER).
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Let \(X\) be a set, \(R\) a PER, and \(f : \nabla X \to (\mathbb{N} / R, \in)\) a morphism in \(\omegaSets\).
Choose a code \(e \in \mathbb{N}\) that tracks \(f\).
Then for all \(x \in X\) and \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), \(e \cdot n\) is defined and \(e \cdot n \in f(x) \in \mathbb{N} / R\). Since \(R\) is a PER, this implies that \(f(x) = f(y)\) for all \(x, y \in X\), so \(f\) is constant.
