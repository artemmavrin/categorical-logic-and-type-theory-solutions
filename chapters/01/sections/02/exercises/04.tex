\begin{exercise}
Check that for a PER \(R\) one has \(R \subseteq \left|R\right|^2\).
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Let \(R\) be a partial equivalence relation (on an arbitrary set, not necessarily just \(\mathbb{N}\)), and let \((x, y) \in R\).
Since \(R\) is symmetric, we also have \((y, x) \in R\), and since \(R\) is transitive, it follows that \((x, x) \in R\) and \((y, y) \in R\).
Thus, \(x \in |R|\) and \(y \in |R|\), so \((x, y) \in \left|R\right|^2\).
Therefore \(R \subseteq \left|R\right|^2\).
\end{solution}
