\begin{exercise}
For an arbitrary category \(\cat{B}\), consider the domain functor \(\dom : \cat{B}^{\rightarrow} \to \cat{B}\).
\begin{parts}
\part
Describe the fibre category above \(I \in \cat{B}\).
It is usually called the \textbf{opslice category} or simply \textbf{opslice} and written as \(I \setminus \cat{B}\).
\part
Show that \(\dom\) is a fibration (without any assumptions about \(\cat{B}\)).
\part
Show also that for each \(I \in \cat{B}\) the domain functor \(\dom_I : \cat{B} / I \to \cat{B}\) is a fibration.
\end{parts}
