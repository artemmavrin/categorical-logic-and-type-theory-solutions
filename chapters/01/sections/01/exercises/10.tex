\begin{exercise}
Let \(\Fld\) be the category of fields and field homomorphisms; \(\Vect\) is the category of vector spaces: objects are triples \((K, V, \cdot)\) where \(K\) is a field of scalars, \(V\) is an Abelian group of vectors and \(\cdot : K \times V \to V\) is an action of scalar multiplication (which distributes both over scalar and over vector addition).
A morphism (\(K, V, \cdot) \to (L, W, \cdot)\) in \(\Vect\) is a pair \((u, f)\) where \(u : K \to L\) is a field homomorphism and \(f : V \to W\) a group homomorphism such that \(f(a \cdot x) = u(a) f(x)\) for all \(a \in K\) and \(x \in V\).

Check that the obvious forgetful functor \(\Vect \to \Fld\) is a fibration.
What are the fibres?
Which maps are Cartesian?
