\begin{exercise}
Define a left adjoint \(F : \Fam(\Sets) \to \Pred\) to the inclusion functor
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
\Pred \arrow[dr] \arrow[rr, hookrightarrow] && \Fam(\Sets) \arrow[dl] \arrow[ll, bend right, "F"{above}] \\
& \Sets
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
such that: (1) \(F\) makes the triangle commute (so it does not change the index set), and (2) \(F\) commutes with substitution.
