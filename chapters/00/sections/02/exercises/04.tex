\begin{exercise}
Check that the operation \((I, X) \mapsto \{I \mid X\}\) yields a functor \(\Fam(\Sets) \to \Sets\), and show that it is right adjoint to the terminal object functor \(\Sets \to \Fam(\Sets)\), mapping a set \(J\) to the family of singletons \((\{*\})_{j \in J}\).
Describe the unit and counit of the adjunction explicitly.
